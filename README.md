the dice game Left-Center-Right

Project Proposal -- LEFT-CENTER-RIGHT -- a game of dice

Organization: Bratwurst Productions


For our project we have decided to implement a multiplayer game of dice known as L-C-R, or “Left-Center-Right.” The rules are simple and the game is a fun one for parties, because it can be played for cash, making it more interesting for social gatherings.

We propose that we use firebase to track the game’s states, and that we develop a game of L-C-R which can support any number of players from 3 to 10, including at least one human player, with the rest of the players automated.

The game will be designed using project boards and developed using our organization’s shared repository. Issues will be defined and resolved in github issues.

The MVP will include all needed functionality from the project requirements, as well as having elements from API calls including popular image and music APIs.
